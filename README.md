# Keylogger
Design and Implementation of Python-based Keylogger for Windows OS in a controlled virtual environment.

This project demonstrates the working of a browser-based keylogger in a controlled virtual environment for educational and cybersecurity awareness purposes.

*It simulates a phishing login page that captures user input and stores it on a local server to help understand:*
How keylogging attacks work,
Client-server communication,
Phishing mechanisms,
Importance of secure web development.

*Technologies Used*:
HTML,
JavaScript,
PHP,
Apache Server,
Kali Linux.

*Basic Working*:
Fake login page is hosted on a local server->
User enters credentials->
JavaScript captures keystrokes->
Data is sent to backend (PHP)->
Logs are stored for analysis.

Documentation:
The complete project documentation (including methodology, objectives, screenshots, and explanation) is available in the attached .doc file in this repository.

*This project highlights how easily phishing and keylogging attacks can be performed and emphasizes the importance of:*
Secure coding practices,
Cybersecurity awareness,
Ethical hacking principles.
